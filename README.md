Business problem

Global Mart is an online supergiant store that has worldwide operations. This store takes orders and delivers across the globe and deals with all the major product categories — consumer, corporate and home office.

As a sales manager for this store, you have to forecast the sales of the products for the next 6 months, so that you have a proper estimate and can plan your inventory and business processes accordingly.

The store dataset has the following 5 attributes and their data description is as given below:
 
 
Attributes	Description
Order-Date - 	The date on which the order was placed
Segment	- The segment to which the product belongs
Market - 	The market to which the customer belongs
Sales	- Total sales value of the transaction
Profit	- Profit made on the transaction
 

If you check the entries in the dataset, you will see that the store caters to 7 different geographical market segments and 3 major customer segments, i.e. consumer, corporate and home as can be seen in the table below.

 

Geo Markets

Africa
APAC (Asia Pacific)	
Canada	
EMEA(Middle East)	 
EU (European Union)	 
LATAM (Latin America)	 
US (United States)	 
 

 

Based on these, there are 21 unique "Market-Segments" for which the sales forecasts can be made. That is the dataset needs to be prepared such that you get the Order-Date, Sales and Profit for the 21 market segments.

 

Now, due to certain unpredictable circumstances in the market, as a company, you are prioritizing only the best and most consistent market segment in terms of profitability. You want to see which market segment is the most consistently profitable. And then, you want to forecast the sales for that most consistently profitable market-segment only. This way you know that the market region your company is investing in will be beneficial for the company as the forecasts will be reliable. As of now, you do not want to focus on other market segments that might have not been very consistent and profitable to your company.

 

So, not all of these 21 market segments are important from the store’s point of view. You need to find out the most consistently profitable market-segment from the above and forecast the sales and demand for that single market-segment only and not for all.

 

Now the question is how do you find that most profitable market segment from the 21 market segments?
